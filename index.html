        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The project introduces triangle meshes and interpolating complex curves using computer graphics. The first section works with
            bezier curves as an iterative way to define natural curves using control points. Parameters can be used to find specific points on
            the curve through simple linear interpolation which is mindblowing. We can again sample this curve to construct meshes and curved surfaces.
            Meshes are made of triangles which are defined at three vertices. Due to many triangles being adjacent to each other, the organization of the triangles can change
            and more importantly since triangles can be split into triangles, meshes can refined computationally. The project goes through how to operate on various edges
            and faces in the mesh.

        <b>
            Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
        </b>
        <p>
            De Caseljau's Algorithm recursively interpolates a set of control points by finding a set of points that
            interpolate the ith and i+1th control point using a parameter t. For each t parameter, a point on the bezier curve is evaluated
            when the recursion reaches its base case with one point. Essentially, a curve can be drawn by sweeping over or sampling a range of t, that
            defines points on the curve.
        </p>
        <br />


        <b>
            Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

            I created a .bzc file with 6 control points defined at the following positions:

        <p>
            For surfaces, two parameters u and v are supplied to the interpolation algorithm as analogs to the t parameter in the 1D case.
            The control points of the surface are defined as an nxn grid where first the rows of the grid are interpolated using 1D Casteljau using the parameter u.
            The interpolated point from this operation is added to a list and each of these points act as a control point for another 1D interpolation using the parameter v.
            The resulting point lies on the surface with parameter u and v.

        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
        </b>
        <p>
            To calculate the area-weighted vertex normal of a specific vertex, the normals of the faces that are incident to the vertex are summed and normalized. The area-weighted normal
            for each face is found by taking the cross products of edges of each face.
            The implementation used the halfedge iterator to locate one side of each edge that are incident to the vertex. To circularly iterate through all the faces, the twin half edge is extracted
            and the normal of the face corresponding to the half edge is summed with a running total. The algorithm terminates when the half edge being evaluated is the same as the half edge we started with
            meaning we have circularly traversed all faces surrounding the vertex.

        </b>
        <p>
            Edge flip was implemented by reassigning all relavent mesh componenent attributes such that the shared edge
            between the two triangles is assigned to the opposite pair of vertices. Doing this simply required recovering all the relevant components using half-edge
            relations and then updating the pointers/attributes stored in each component.

        </b>
        <p>
            When implementing this part we drew before and after diagrams with each component labeled. Then we wrote out what the updated pointer
            values would be for every single component, whether it was a redundant reassignment or not. Despite this,
            there was one bug that manifested after several flips which caused holes. To debug this we rechecked our written pointer reassignments
            and realized we forgot to include reassignments for twin edges outside the faces that were part of the flip. By having clearly written work
            we were able to avoid tediously chasing pointers in the code.

        <p>
            Similar to how the flipping operation was implemented, the split operation reassigns the pointers of each mesh component involved in the operation.
            Splitting also requires creating some new components (3 edges, 6 halfedges, 2 faces, and a new vertex).
            In the split, an additional mid vertex is created and assigned to the midpoint of the original edge.

            Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
        </b>
        <p>
            Loop subdivison upsamples the mesh by subdividing each triangle 4-1. First we calculate what the new position of each vertex should be and store it
            in the Vertex::newPosition attribute. Then we find what the new position for every edge's new vertex would be and store that in Edge::newPosition. Then we split every existing edge,
            making sure to skip newly created edges to avoid infinite loops by checking their vertices to see if either are new. Then we flip every edge that is connected to one new and one old vertex. Finally we
            update every vertex position to its new position.

        <b>
            Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
        </b>
        <p>
            Sharp edges and corners are rounded out by loop subdivision as can be seen here from the pot. Presplitting edges can deform the shape to emphasis different corners and edges.

            Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
        </b>
        <p>
            To make the cube symmetric, one can preprocess all the initial edges that intersect a face by spliting each. This makes four triangles for each face which allows for the subdivision to become symmetric. This occurs
            since before when the cube face edges were not split, each face was made of two triangles that had a diagonal that was longer than the other two sides. In a 4-1 subdivision scheme, the new triangles are only equilateral
            if the original triangle was aswell. When we split the edge, the face has 4 equilateral triangles that result in a symmetric design where all triangles are equilateral.
